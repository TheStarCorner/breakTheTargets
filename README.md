# Overview


DISCLAIMER: This game includes music and sound effects from a Nintendo game, Smash Bros. Melee. This project is non-profit and is part of Fair-Use (Section 107).


The point of the game is to break all of the targets by touching them. There are eleveen total, so try to get them all! (Note: The game is in an unfinished state, so getting all of the targets does not bring up a result screen.)

# Development Environment

I have used Python and Arcade while developing this program. I also used the application, Tiled, to make a map for the game. 
I was able to incorporate all three into one 2D platformer.
